# weird_alley
collection of general weirdness

## File Structure
• If you have a GIF you'd like to submit for a weird-over, pop it into "Templates"
• If you have any images of people you'd like to see applied to a GIF, pop a pic of them into "Assets >> Raw" (if the image has a transparent bg already and is ready to go, just put it in "Assets" and name it properly).

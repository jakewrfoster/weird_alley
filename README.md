# Welcome to Weird Alley
collection of general weirdness

## File Structure
• If you have a GIF you'd like to submit for a weird-over, pop it into "Templates"

• If you have any images of people you'd like to see applied to a GIF, pop a pic of them into "Assets >> Raw" (if the image has a transparent bg already and is ready to go, just put it in "Assets" and name it properly).

### Quick Reference
• assets: assets go _on_ other things
• templates: other things go _on_ templates 
• masterpieces: these are finished works and PSDs
